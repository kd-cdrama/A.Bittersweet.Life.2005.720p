00:01:02.714 --> 00:01:04.807
One fine spring day...

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.544
a disciple looked at some branches
blowing in the wind.

00:01:07.586 --> 00:01:09.053
He asked his master...

00:01:10.188 --> 00:01:15.853
"Master, are the branches moving
or is it the wind?"

00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:20.088
Not even glancing to where
his pupil was pointing...

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.358
the master smiled and said...

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:28.463
"That which moves is neither
the branches nor the wind..."

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:30.063
"It's your heart and mind."

00:01:46.656 --> 00:01:49.684
Sunwoo, you should
go downstairs for a moment.

00:01:49.726 --> 00:01:50.685
Why?

00:01:50.727 --> 00:01:51.955
There's some trouble.

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:57.425
Okay, I'll handle it.

00:03:50.073 --> 00:03:53.201
I'm sorry, but
business hours are over.

00:03:53.243 --> 00:03:57.509
Please get up and leave
before I count to three. One.

00:04:03.353 --> 00:04:04.615
Two.

00:04:08.425 --> 00:04:09.425
Three!

00:04:12.228 --> 00:04:13.593
Sit down, stupid!

00:04:19.034 --> 00:04:20.092
Min-gi, lock the door.

00:04:39.287 --> 00:04:40.379
You son of a bitch!

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:56.862
See you tomorrow.

00:04:56.904 --> 00:04:57.944
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

00:05:10.551 --> 00:05:14.749
Yes, boss. I'll transfer
the money in the morning.

00:05:16.323 --> 00:05:17.963
All right, we'll close
for the night, sir.

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:10.139
So, did you take care
of yesterday's business?

00:06:10.181 --> 00:06:11.181
Yes, sir.

00:06:11.976 --> 00:06:15.036
Good. You always seem
to get things done.

00:06:18.082 --> 00:06:21.977
It looks like Chairman Baek's son
is the one making trouble.

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:25.379
Yes, it didn't seem like
Chairman Baek did it himself.

00:06:25.421 --> 00:06:28.416
Chairman Baek's son used
to be a loan shark...

00:06:28.458 --> 00:06:30.751
I heard he's interested
in this business.

00:06:30.793 --> 00:06:31.851
Abalone, sir.

00:06:32.495 --> 00:06:36.123
There's talk that he started
dealings with Southeast Asia.

00:06:36.165 --> 00:06:37.165
Why?

00:06:38.534 --> 00:06:45.233
He's pushing businesses to hire
Filipina girls instead of Russians.

00:06:45.275 --> 00:06:49.734
Assholes. Like father, like son.

00:06:51.446 --> 00:06:52.446
It's me...

00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:54.181
Moon Suk.

00:06:56.585 --> 00:06:59.412
I shouldn't have brought my car...

00:06:59.454 --> 00:07:01.081
I hope I'm not interrupting?

00:07:02.491 --> 00:07:03.491
Oh, it's okay.

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:05.552
What's that? Abalone?

00:07:05.594 --> 00:07:07.053
Get another for me.

00:07:07.095 --> 00:07:08.095
Yes, sir.

00:07:11.866 --> 00:07:14.027
Hey, sorry about yesterday.

00:07:14.702 --> 00:07:17.396
I can't believe that happened.
I just stepped out for a second.

00:07:17.438 --> 00:07:18.998
You must have been busy
enough upstairs.

00:07:24.211 --> 00:07:26.805
Those guys yesterday
were just local boys.

00:07:26.847 --> 00:07:28.246
Nothing to worry about, sir.

00:07:28.916 --> 00:07:32.040
- What do you think you're doing?
- Sir?

00:07:32.083 --> 00:07:33.848
Is this how you do business?

00:07:35.088 --> 00:07:37.315
- It was just...
- Get out now.

00:07:37.357 --> 00:07:38.790
Get out and wait for me!

00:08:03.849 --> 00:08:05.709
Be smart.

00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:07.810
Things are going good for you now.

00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:10.447
But the world is not easy.

00:08:10.489 --> 00:08:15.619
You can do 100 things right, but
one mistake can destroy everything.

00:08:16.995 --> 00:08:18.485
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

00:08:20.465 --> 00:08:23.492
I'll try to sort things out
with Chairman Baek.

00:08:23.534 --> 00:08:28.064
Anyhow, the real reason
I asked you here...

00:08:28.106 --> 00:08:32.101
I have to go to Shanghai
tomorrow afternoon on business...

00:08:32.143 --> 00:08:34.441
I have a favor to ask
before I leave.

00:08:37.681 --> 00:08:38.773
The thing is...

00:08:44.621 --> 00:08:45.947
Pour me a drink.

00:08:45.989 --> 00:08:46.989
Oh, yes, sir. Sorry.

00:08:55.732 --> 00:08:57.495
The truth is,

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.665
I have a young girlfriend.

00:09:04.573 --> 00:09:07.301
Someone I really care about.

00:09:07.343 --> 00:09:10.437
She's not like you and me.
She's a special kind of person.

00:09:15.184 --> 00:09:17.118
What, am I boring you?

00:09:19.288 --> 00:09:20.481
Uh... Congratulations, sir.

00:09:20.523 --> 00:09:23.449
Never mind "Congratulations."

00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:27.353
The problem is, I think
She's seeing a new guy.

00:09:27.395 --> 00:09:29.192
Some young guy is hanging around her.

00:09:30.331 --> 00:09:33.892
It's driving me crazy,
and I couldn't tell anyone else.

00:09:34.536 --> 00:09:37.528
You know, you're the only one
I can really talk to about this.

00:09:38.306 --> 00:09:41.742
No one else knows how much
this worries me.

00:09:42.777 --> 00:09:46.872
So, I'd like you to watch Heesoo
for just three days.

00:09:48.215 --> 00:09:49.375
Watch her?

00:09:49.983 --> 00:09:53.078
Watch over her.
Take care of her.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.780
See if she's really seeing someone.

00:09:54.822 --> 00:09:56.782
Maybe the bastard's just bothering her.

00:09:56.824 --> 00:09:59.657
See whether she's given him
her body and soul and all.

00:10:00.894 --> 00:10:07.491
You know young people,
a hand could brush a shoulder...

00:10:07.533 --> 00:10:10.094
then they hold hands, then kiss,
and then... you know...

00:10:10.136 --> 00:10:12.001
These things happen.

00:10:15.775 --> 00:10:20.439
But I can't stand thinking
about her like that.

00:10:21.414 --> 00:10:22.473
Stupid, isn't it?

00:10:22.515 --> 00:10:23.607
No, sir.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:25.709
Stupid.

00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:29.212
So... I want you to find out
who she's meeting.

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:31.648
And what she does when they meet.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.180
Just for 3 days.

00:10:33.959 --> 00:10:37.895
This is Heesoo's address
and phone number.

00:10:39.331 --> 00:10:46.162
I hope she's not seeing him,
but if she is...

00:10:46.204 --> 00:10:50.199
If they look like they're involved...

00:10:50.241 --> 00:10:52.141
Call me right away.
Or finish them off yourself.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:53.768
Excuse me?

00:10:55.312 --> 00:10:58.674
You know I can't stand
being lied to, right?

00:10:58.716 --> 00:11:01.643
Love isn't love if you're
being lied to.

00:11:01.685 --> 00:11:03.912
You can contact me here
in Shanghai.

00:11:03.954 --> 00:11:05.046
Directly.

00:11:09.593 --> 00:11:10.593
Have a good night.

00:11:11.929 --> 00:11:14.556
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:11:15.165 --> 00:11:16.557
No, sir.

00:11:16.599 --> 00:11:18.426
Have you ever been in love?

00:11:18.468 --> 00:11:21.429
No, you haven't.

00:11:21.471 --> 00:11:24.699
That's why I'm entrusting you
with this job.

00:11:24.741 --> 00:11:26.709
That's why I like you.

00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:31.044
Okay, let's go.

00:11:32.515 --> 00:11:33.515
Goodbye, sir!

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.938
President Kang told me
to give this to you personally.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:16.980
I'm sorry?

00:13:17.882 --> 00:13:20.077
President Kang told me
to give this to you personally.

00:13:22.253 --> 00:13:23.253
What's that?

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.257
Wow, it's so funny-looking.

00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:08.427
It's so like Mr. Kang.

00:14:09.497 --> 00:14:10.497
It's cute.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:12.758
Don't you think so?

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.928
Hello, not yet.

00:14:50.471 --> 00:14:52.735
Already? Hold on a second...

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.774
President Kang also said
I should drive you today.

00:15:03.816 --> 00:15:06.580
Oh, I don't need a ride.
You can go, it's fine.

00:15:07.553 --> 00:15:10.113
- He said I should take you myself.
- I'll let him know about it.

00:15:12.125 --> 00:15:14.650
Well, then, I'll see you later.

00:15:18.196 --> 00:15:21.958
If you need anything,
please contact me here.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.695
It's okay, I don't need it.

00:15:25.604 --> 00:15:27.071
Oh, give it to me anyway.

00:15:30.075 --> 00:15:31.337
Goodbye.

00:15:51.295 --> 00:15:53.388
Heesoo, Heesoo.

00:17:57.282 --> 00:18:00.308
They sure like to get around...
Maybe it's because they're still young?

00:18:03.288 --> 00:18:04.550
Why isn't she getting out?

00:18:52.168 --> 00:18:53.931
Hey, Moon Suk. Everything okay?

00:18:55.571 --> 00:18:56.571
What?

00:18:59.708 --> 00:19:02.569
President Baek, that asshole...

00:19:02.611 --> 00:19:04.470
He keeps calling and bothering me.

00:19:04.512 --> 00:19:06.472
Asking how could we do this to him.

00:19:06.514 --> 00:19:09.442
He says he lost face
because of you.

00:19:09.484 --> 00:19:12.312
He wants to meet you.

00:19:12.354 --> 00:19:18.987
I said no, his guys were to blame.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.854
But he insists on meeting you.

00:19:22.896 --> 00:19:25.425
He's calling me
every 10 minutes.

00:19:25.468 --> 00:19:27.359
I think you should...

00:19:27.401 --> 00:19:30.529
What the...
Who's bugging me now?

00:19:31.639 --> 00:19:36.001
See? He's calling again.
I'm sick of getting it.

00:19:36.043 --> 00:19:37.601
You take care of it now.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.691
Hello, this is Kim Sunwoo.

00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:06.129
Well, if you have something to say,
Come here and tell me yourself.

00:20:06.171 --> 00:20:07.661
I'm hanging up.

00:20:10.575 --> 00:20:11.974
I took care of it.

00:20:12.778 --> 00:20:18.642
Hello, hello.
He... hello? Hello?

00:20:18.684 --> 00:20:21.645
Fucker, hung up on me.

00:20:21.687 --> 00:20:24.514
What a rude bastard. Hello?

00:20:24.556 --> 00:20:25.682
Should I?

00:20:25.724 --> 00:20:26.985
Leave it!

00:20:37.234 --> 00:20:43.002
Laughing? You think that's funny?
Funny huh?

00:20:45.342 --> 00:20:49.604
You go around smiling like an idiot...
That's why you get your ass kicked.

00:20:49.646 --> 00:20:52.306
Damn you bastard, look at me.

00:20:52.348 --> 00:20:54.646
Look at me, damn it.

00:20:56.953 --> 00:20:58.079
Funny?

00:20:59.456 --> 00:21:01.481
I'm sorry, sir.

00:21:03.252 --> 00:21:04.252
Do you think it's funny?

00:21:04.294 --> 00:21:06.721
Funny, funny, funny?

00:21:06.763 --> 00:21:08.754
Funny?

00:21:12.434 --> 00:21:13.696
Shit!

00:21:20.876 --> 00:21:23.401
What hell were you thinking?
You're making it even worse!

00:21:28.817 --> 00:21:30.711
Hey, this is your job.

00:21:30.753 --> 00:21:32.845
I took care of it
because you weren't there.

00:21:32.887 --> 00:21:35.681
This kind of thing is your job.
You should've taken care of it.

00:21:35.723 --> 00:21:37.950
They just want to do business
with us...

00:21:37.992 --> 00:21:42.221
and beat us to the punch
before starting to deal.

00:21:42.263 --> 00:21:43.730
Don't you get it?

00:21:44.365 --> 00:21:46.925
What are you lecturing me now?

00:22:16.596 --> 00:22:18.522
Hey, get the phone over here.

00:22:18.564 --> 00:22:19.656
Yes sir.

00:22:22.568 --> 00:22:23.694
Here, sir.

00:22:30.609 --> 00:22:33.504
What an idiot.

00:22:33.546 --> 00:22:35.138
What? Is this voice dial?

00:22:38.017 --> 00:22:41.213
Don't you think we need
to press the numbers?

00:22:41.886 --> 00:22:43.126
Should I dial it with my mouth?

00:22:47.992 --> 00:22:50.222
Stupid motherfuckers.

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:55.458
Call Moosung from Samseongyo.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.500
Yes, sir.

00:23:40.409 --> 00:23:44.271
You didn't answer your mobile,
so I'm leaving this message.

00:23:44.313 --> 00:23:48.308
If you have some time, I need
your help for a little while.

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:52.846
Just until 3 in the afternoon.
After that, it's fine.

00:23:52.888 --> 00:23:54.447
If you get this message...

00:23:54.489 --> 00:23:55.915
Yes, it's me. It's Sunwoo.

00:23:55.957 --> 00:24:01.020
Ah, yes. At what time?
And right now it's...

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:04.090
I'll be there in an hour
at the latest.

00:24:04.132 --> 00:24:05.565
I'm on my way.

00:24:33.393 --> 00:24:37.989
Mr. Kang said you're a scary guy.

00:24:39.165 --> 00:24:40.530
Excuse me?

00:24:41.134 --> 00:24:42.226
He did?

00:24:43.703 --> 00:24:45.000
Yes...

00:24:52.911 --> 00:24:54.503
You're an enforcer, aren't you?

00:24:59.217 --> 00:25:01.278
I gave you my card the other day.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.810
I work at a hotel.

00:25:08.894 --> 00:25:10.520
So you're an enforcer for the hotel?

00:25:10.562 --> 00:25:11.859
I'm not that kind of person.

00:25:20.004 --> 00:25:21.562
You're so boring to talk to.

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:34.343
Can I ask you something?

00:25:34.385 --> 00:25:35.613
Sure.

00:25:38.781 --> 00:25:40.061
How did you first meet Mr. Kang?

00:25:40.103 --> 00:25:42.594
- Wait a minute.
- Okay.

00:25:44.494 --> 00:25:46.087
How much is the red lamp?

00:25:46.129 --> 00:25:47.956
$280

00:25:47.998 --> 00:25:50.458
$280?

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.367
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

00:25:55.538 --> 00:25:56.538
Let's go.

00:26:01.977 --> 00:26:04.004
What were you saying?

00:26:04.046 --> 00:26:07.015
You asked why I am seeing Mr. Kang?

00:26:08.517 --> 00:26:09.779
Yes.

00:26:10.652 --> 00:26:12.449
Why do you want to know?

00:26:14.289 --> 00:26:17.850
It's just... you don't have
to answer.

00:26:24.298 --> 00:26:26.323
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:26:29.837 --> 00:26:31.566
I'll take that now.

00:26:38.846 --> 00:26:40.039
I'm sorry.

00:26:40.081 --> 00:26:41.378
For what?

00:26:41.916 --> 00:26:43.644
Asking you those questions.

00:26:44.885 --> 00:26:46.284
It's okay.

00:26:47.554 --> 00:26:51.116
Thanks for your time today.
I didn't want to eat by myself.

00:26:51.158 --> 00:26:54.152
If you'd like to take a look,
you can enter through that door.

00:26:54.194 --> 00:26:55.687
How will you return home?

00:26:55.729 --> 00:26:59.927
It's easy to catch a cab here.

00:27:13.579 --> 00:27:14.905
You guys ready?

00:27:14.947 --> 00:27:16.642
- Yeah, ready.
- Okay.

00:27:18.551 --> 00:27:19.984
Let's go.

00:28:40.729 --> 00:28:42.155
Hi, Min-gi.

00:28:42.197 --> 00:28:44.357
Someone came to see you
early this morning.

00:28:44.399 --> 00:28:45.325
Who was it?

00:28:45.367 --> 00:28:47.594
Oh Moosung. Do you know him?
He's one mean-looking guy.

00:28:47.636 --> 00:28:49.529
Moosung? I don't know him.

00:28:49.571 --> 00:28:51.030
Anything else?

00:28:51.072 --> 00:28:53.466
Moon Suk is looking for you.
You want to talk to him now?

00:28:53.508 --> 00:28:56.442
No, Min-gi, don't put him through.

00:28:57.344 --> 00:28:59.175
I'll be going to the hotel soon.

00:29:07.421 --> 00:29:09.286
Well, well, well.

00:29:10.683 --> 00:29:11.683
Bottoms up.

00:29:11.725 --> 00:29:13.318
Someone's coming.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.954
Hey, Sunwoo, come over here.

00:29:15.996 --> 00:29:17.258
Sunwoo?

00:29:18.598 --> 00:29:19.624
Hello.

00:29:19.666 --> 00:29:20.691
Come here, come.

00:29:20.733 --> 00:29:21.592
Come.

00:29:21.634 --> 00:29:23.561
Why don't you come over
here for a second?

00:29:23.603 --> 00:29:26.264
Ji-hyun, this is Mr. Kim's seat.

00:29:26.306 --> 00:29:27.830
Come.

00:29:30.343 --> 00:29:31.769
Have a seat.

00:29:31.811 --> 00:29:35.239
Hey, why are you always so
secretive about the thing you do?

00:29:35.281 --> 00:29:36.867
What's up?

00:29:36.909 --> 00:29:37.909
Have a drink.

00:29:37.951 --> 00:29:40.076
Girls, get out.

00:29:40.118 --> 00:29:41.144
What are you doing?

00:29:41.186 --> 00:29:43.547
Don't ruin the fun. Relax.

00:29:43.589 --> 00:29:45.682
Say hello to President Baek.

00:29:45.724 --> 00:29:47.988
From the Baek-Sang Management Agency.

00:29:50.996 --> 00:29:52.989
Hi. I'm sorry I was rude
the other day.

00:29:53.031 --> 00:29:55.825
- I guess we had a misunderstanding.
- Is that why you came here?

00:29:55.867 --> 00:29:57.160
Yes, that and...

00:29:57.202 --> 00:30:00.363
There was no misunderstanding.

00:30:00.405 --> 00:30:02.395
Who do you think we are?

00:30:03.441 --> 00:30:05.500
- Hey, Sunwoo!
- You be quiet.

00:30:06.143 --> 00:30:08.070
Don't use your people
to mess with me anymore.

00:30:08.112 --> 00:30:09.136
Sunwoo!

00:30:10.181 --> 00:30:12.672
He's here as my guest today!

00:30:14.085 --> 00:30:18.147
Damn it, how could you
do this to me?

00:30:18.189 --> 00:30:19.816
I can do this because it's you.

00:30:27.864 --> 00:30:32.995
Kim Sunwoo, do you think
the world is all yours?

00:30:34.938 --> 00:30:36.599
Don't do anything you'll regret.

00:31:01.623 --> 00:31:02.623
Aren't you going?

00:31:02.665 --> 00:31:04.792
- You go first.
- See you.

00:31:55.214 --> 00:31:56.340
Heesoo.

00:31:57.583 --> 00:31:58.914
Hi.

00:32:00.686 --> 00:32:02.179
Did you have a good date today?

00:32:02.221 --> 00:32:03.688
Stop kidding.

00:32:06.292 --> 00:32:08.157
Where did you say
you'd sleep tonight?

00:32:14.266 --> 00:32:15.266
Thanks.

00:32:15.959 --> 00:32:16.959
How should we do this?

00:32:17.001 --> 00:32:18.798
I will call you tomorrow.

00:32:21.406 --> 00:32:22.498
Just call me...

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:23.292
Yeah, Min-gi.

00:33:28.069 --> 00:33:30.864
That asshole can't drive for shit!

00:33:30.906 --> 00:33:32.464
I wasn't talking...

00:33:34.643 --> 00:33:36.110
I wasn't talking to you.

00:33:36.912 --> 00:33:38.106
What about Moon Suk?

00:33:39.114 --> 00:33:40.877
Did you go down to the club?

00:33:41.817 --> 00:33:43.079
Ok.

00:34:39.872 --> 00:34:40.872
Who is it?

00:34:45.711 --> 00:34:47.178
Who is it?

00:35:15.005 --> 00:35:16.063
Seyoon, don't!

00:35:20.577 --> 00:35:21.936
Seyoon!

00:35:21.978 --> 00:35:23.036
Stop it!

00:35:28.585 --> 00:35:29.585
You bastard!

00:36:13.928 --> 00:36:16.055
You know who I'm calling, don't you?

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:20.530
Any last words?

00:36:43.789 --> 00:36:45.518
You finish them off yourself.

00:37:38.809 --> 00:37:40.436
Okay. This is what we'll do.

00:37:41.745 --> 00:37:43.212
I'll give you a chance.

00:37:44.081 --> 00:37:45.514
Listen. Both of you.

00:37:47.217 --> 00:37:49.776
You must never see each other again.

00:37:50.353 --> 00:37:54.315
All this today never happened
for any of us, including me...

00:37:54.357 --> 00:37:56.154
This moment never existed.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.653
Erase it completely.

00:37:58.695 --> 00:38:00.993
Not just from your memories,
but from your habits, too.

00:38:02.265 --> 00:38:03.960
Don't say it's hard...

00:38:04.467 --> 00:38:07.995
Because this can get more serious
than either of you can imagine.

00:38:08.037 --> 00:38:09.896
No point thinking about it
any longer so...

00:38:09.938 --> 00:38:11.633
You, hurry, get dressed and leave.

00:38:20.582 --> 00:38:22.106
Seyoon, don't do this.

00:38:23.618 --> 00:38:27.645
- Seyoon!
- Heesoo, Heesoo.

00:38:28.883 --> 00:38:29.883
Heesoo.

00:38:29.925 --> 00:38:31.750
- Leave me alone!
- Listen to me!

00:38:31.792 --> 00:38:32.816
Let me go!

00:38:37.531 --> 00:38:40.492
Do you really believe we can just
forget about what happened here tonight?

00:38:40.534 --> 00:38:42.361
- This...
- Do you... really... think so?

00:38:42.403 --> 00:38:46.863
I was just looking
for the best way out of this.

00:38:47.942 --> 00:38:50.769
Okay, you can go now.

00:38:50.811 --> 00:38:52.204
Heesoo.

00:38:52.246 --> 00:38:54.475
I don't have anything else to say.

00:38:55.248 --> 00:38:57.614
You understand I can't say
anything, right?

00:38:58.151 --> 00:39:00.813
Should I thank you
for saving my life or something?

00:39:04.023 --> 00:39:08.426
Please leave now.
I'll do as you say.

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:12.095
Heesoo.

00:39:17.169 --> 00:39:18.796
That's not the way it is.

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:23.131
You know it can't be erased.

00:39:57.875 --> 00:39:59.536
Hey, open the window.

00:40:05.782 --> 00:40:06.976
Hey!

00:40:56.097 --> 00:40:58.258
That fucking asshole!

00:41:07.641 --> 00:41:09.506
What's wrong with that guy?

00:41:11.311 --> 00:41:12.311
Hey!

00:41:21.655 --> 00:41:22.986
Asshole!

00:42:27.618 --> 00:42:28.778
Who's there?

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.945
Get out here,

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:35.151
you pricks!

00:42:36.059 --> 00:42:39.620
Come on out. Now.

00:43:04.019 --> 00:43:05.816
Are you alone?

00:43:08.623 --> 00:43:10.083
Let's just go one-on-one then.

00:43:10.125 --> 00:43:12.986
I'm Oh Moo-sung from Samseongyo.

00:43:13.028 --> 00:43:15.388
Whoever the fuck you are,
just get over here.

00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:17.125
I'm sick of talking.

00:43:27.808 --> 00:43:29.401
Calm down.

00:43:29.443 --> 00:43:31.437
I only came to give you a message.

00:43:31.479 --> 00:43:33.310
Did Mr. Baek send you?

00:43:35.116 --> 00:43:36.606
Tell me.

00:43:37.451 --> 00:43:41.581
Apologize.
Then nothing will happen.

00:43:42.522 --> 00:43:46.014
"I. Was. Wrong."
Three little words.

00:43:46.659 --> 00:43:50.857
If you say those three words,
nothing horrible will happen.

00:43:51.664 --> 00:43:56.328
"I. Was. Wrong."
Just three words.

00:43:57.537 --> 00:43:59.937
Fuck. Off. Asshole.

00:44:02.108 --> 00:44:04.002
Think it over.

00:44:04.044 --> 00:44:07.206
Stop talking shit and
get the fuck outta here.

00:45:15.344 --> 00:45:17.608
Everyone's got to live their life.

00:45:47.375 --> 00:45:49.235
Aren't you going
to answer the phone?

00:45:49.277 --> 00:45:51.541
It's okay, it's not important.

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:01.478
Would you like some coffee?

00:46:03.857 --> 00:46:06.485
No, it's okay.
I have to go soon.

00:46:10.664 --> 00:46:11.995
Come over here.

00:46:23.976 --> 00:46:25.803
You look pretty upset.

00:46:25.845 --> 00:46:27.142
What's wrong?

00:46:28.948 --> 00:46:30.506
No, I'm ok.

00:46:32.118 --> 00:46:33.710
Hey!

00:46:34.754 --> 00:46:37.047
But I'm moving out.

00:46:37.089 --> 00:46:38.750
I put this house up for sale.

00:46:47.032 --> 00:46:49.466
Do you know why I like you?

00:46:51.369 --> 00:46:55.765
It's because you don't care
what other people think.

00:46:55.807 --> 00:46:57.001
That's interesting.

00:46:58.109 --> 00:47:01.004
I used to think you were to young.

00:47:01.046 --> 00:47:03.138
But I still come
to see you, like today.

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:05.546
And you still make me look for you.

00:47:06.183 --> 00:47:08.048
That's what I like about you.

00:47:10.788 --> 00:47:15.487
What do you think it is?
Being young is a gift, too.

00:47:17.127 --> 00:47:23.293
As you get older,
you lose patience.

00:49:50.374 --> 00:49:53.309
Ma'am... ma'am...

00:49:55.846 --> 00:49:57.541
Ma'am... ma'am...

00:50:00.316 --> 00:50:06.846
Ma'am... ma'am...

00:50:27.609 --> 00:50:30.373
Hey, Sunwoo.

00:50:30.912 --> 00:50:37.210
Well, well...
What's a great guy like you...

00:50:37.252 --> 00:50:40.153
doing in a place like this, huh?

00:50:42.490 --> 00:50:47.686
Oh my, you fucked up
pretty bad, didn't you?

00:50:47.728 --> 00:50:52.495
Do you know what you're doing now?

00:50:54.701 --> 00:50:59.197
Shit, fucking rotten.

00:50:59.239 --> 00:51:02.299
Don't waste time,
just get rid of him.

00:51:49.087 --> 00:51:52.021
This is really gross.

00:51:54.758 --> 00:51:57.953
Where's the cocky Mr. Kim now?

00:51:57.995 --> 00:52:03.297
Smile, like a professional. Smile.

00:52:07.538 --> 00:52:10.701
We'll never forget about this.

00:52:19.916 --> 00:52:23.682
You have no idea what's happening.

00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:37.298
Keep your fucking head down, asshole!

00:53:34.087 --> 00:53:35.782
Why'd you do it?

00:53:39.225 --> 00:53:41.556
Why didn't you just call me?

00:53:43.362 --> 00:53:45.989
It's not like you.

00:53:46.031 --> 00:53:47.931
So what was the reason?

00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:54.104
Don't feel like talking?

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:56.505
Want it to end like this?

00:54:34.478 --> 00:54:36.605
This is how things work
in this business.

00:54:37.381 --> 00:54:39.042
Don't blame anybody.

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:45.886
The world's a funny place.

00:54:49.191 --> 00:54:51.185
You know what?

00:54:51.227 --> 00:54:54.788
People don't matter for shit.

00:54:54.830 --> 00:54:57.094
No one can ever see
what's coming next.

00:55:00.102 --> 00:55:01.569
What are you going to do?

00:55:03.439 --> 00:55:05.304
Relax and just sit tight.

00:55:06.008 --> 00:55:07.008
Mr. Moon.

00:55:10.545 --> 00:55:14.948
Yes, sir. Okay.

00:55:18.353 --> 00:55:21.516
The boss is giving you a chance.

00:55:25.026 --> 00:55:27.053
Why didn't you tell me?

00:55:27.095 --> 00:55:29.928
Why did you make that mistake?

00:55:33.767 --> 00:55:38.261
If the two of them
never meet again...

00:55:39.006 --> 00:55:40.598
Go on.

00:55:42.743 --> 00:55:48.841
If they can keep that promise,
I thought it would be best.

00:55:51.085 --> 00:55:55.180
No... not that kind of thing.
Tell me the real reason.

00:55:56.422 --> 00:55:58.890
Just be honest.

00:55:59.792 --> 00:56:04.593
Was it because of her?

00:56:06.466 --> 00:56:08.161
What?

00:56:11.471 --> 00:56:12.699
You can't say?

00:56:16.808 --> 00:56:18.935
Put Moon back on.

00:56:18.977 --> 00:56:20.837
Yes, sir. Okay.

00:56:20.879 --> 00:56:25.282
Yes.

00:56:25.951 --> 00:56:27.543
Okay, sir.

00:56:29.087 --> 00:56:30.384
Grab his arms.

00:56:31.515 --> 00:56:32.515
Hey, what are you doing?

00:56:32.557 --> 00:56:35.253
- Let me go, asshole.
- Bring it here.

00:56:35.961 --> 00:56:38.554
What are you doing?

00:56:40.364 --> 00:56:42.855
Let me go,

00:56:43.734 --> 00:56:49.732
Hey! Hey, Moon.

00:56:49.774 --> 00:56:51.173
Don't do this. Don't.

00:56:59.350 --> 00:57:02.477
- Don't do this.
- Hold him tight.

00:58:02.844 --> 00:58:03.970
Hey, Moon!!

00:58:06.847 --> 00:58:10.681
Hey! Moon, ah, Moon, Moon.

00:58:15.822 --> 00:58:23.822
Moon, don't do this.

00:58:27.968 --> 00:58:29.958
You...

00:59:44.657 --> 00:59:48.388
Was the hole too shallow?

00:59:49.128 --> 00:59:52.063
Congratulations, anyway.
You survived.

01:00:48.587 --> 01:00:52.387
There's a present for you
in the bag. Open it.

01:00:55.594 --> 01:00:58.358
Don't play games
with another man's life.

01:01:00.298 --> 01:01:05.160
Ha-ha. You asshole.

01:01:05.202 --> 01:01:09.434
You're trying to be cool
to the end, huh?

01:01:14.145 --> 01:01:15.237
Is this cool?

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.654
Do as I say, asshole.

01:01:33.196 --> 01:01:35.357
He says you have 15 minutes.

01:01:36.099 --> 01:01:39.330
Call him as soon as you figure out
what you should say.

01:01:45.441 --> 01:01:47.840
Remember what happened
with Young-duk back then?

01:01:50.412 --> 01:01:53.677
You probably told him
something like this...

01:01:55.651 --> 01:01:59.382
"No turning back.
Just accept it."

01:02:00.556 --> 01:02:02.820
And you just cut his wrist.

01:02:03.592 --> 01:02:05.457
It was awesome.

01:02:11.132 --> 01:02:15.327
Spend your 15 minutes wisely.
Don't disappoint the boss.

01:02:15.369 --> 01:02:17.234
You owe him your life.

01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:27.237
They're probably digging the hole
three times deeper this time.

01:02:37.324 --> 01:02:38.586
Here.

01:04:23.491 --> 01:04:27.587
Yes, I see.

01:04:37.439 --> 01:04:44.637
Did you beg for forgiveness?
So this is how it ends.

01:04:44.679 --> 01:04:48.136
You're one lucky bastard.

01:04:48.916 --> 01:04:50.440
Give it here.

01:04:56.457 --> 01:05:00.257
What's this? There's no battery!

01:06:53.836 --> 01:06:55.360
Step back.

01:08:34.665 --> 01:08:38.157
Stop digging. We're so fucked.

01:09:43.931 --> 01:09:48.293
Oh, those little shits.
Like they haven't done enough.

01:09:48.335 --> 01:09:50.095
They're worse than we are.

01:09:50.137 --> 01:09:52.064
Seems you have a lot of guests.

01:09:52.106 --> 01:09:53.532
Yes.

01:09:53.574 --> 01:09:57.703
He wants to run again...

01:10:00.313 --> 01:10:02.781
Anyway, I heard the news.

01:10:04.584 --> 01:10:06.643
How did this happen?

01:10:08.988 --> 01:10:11.215
It's a long story...

01:10:11.257 --> 01:10:17.388
You should have just left it
to us from the beginning.

01:10:24.836 --> 01:10:27.163
I'm sorry. I was rude.

01:10:27.205 --> 01:10:30.470
No, it's mostly my fault.

01:10:30.976 --> 01:10:34.434
If the hammer is light,
the nail will rise back up.

01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:41.877
Let's get things straight.

01:10:41.919 --> 01:10:45.218
What would you like us
to do for you?

01:10:59.837 --> 01:11:05.775
Years ago, a smart young man
was working for me.

01:11:06.443 --> 01:11:09.404
One day I got him to do a simple job.

01:11:09.446 --> 01:11:12.540
I guess he thought it was
no big deal. He made a mistake.

01:11:13.216 --> 01:11:17.512
Thinking about it now,
it wasn't such a serious mistake.

01:11:17.554 --> 01:11:20.181
I could have just told him off
and let it go.

01:11:20.223 --> 01:11:23.651
But he was kind of strange.

01:11:23.693 --> 01:11:26.520
He wouldn't admit
it was his fault.

01:11:26.562 --> 01:11:29.326
He said he didn't do
anything wrong.

01:11:29.965 --> 01:11:33.126
He could've been right.
It might have been my fault.

01:11:33.168 --> 01:11:38.098
But what are families for?

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:41.101
If the boss says you're wrong,
then you're wrong...

01:11:41.143 --> 01:11:44.340
even if you didn't really do it.

01:11:46.247 --> 01:11:48.741
Then it's over. Period!

01:11:48.783 --> 01:11:51.650
But that guy lost his hand.

01:11:52.587 --> 01:11:58.457
One promising guy's life ended
just like that one morning.

01:12:06.134 --> 01:12:09.728
This time, one hand is not enough.

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:16.534
Hello? Just a second.

01:12:16.576 --> 01:12:17.975
Min-gi!

01:12:24.117 --> 01:12:25.812
Yes, hello.

01:12:32.925 --> 01:12:38.454
Yes, I see.

01:13:56.138 --> 01:13:58.003
Yes, President Won.

01:13:58.641 --> 01:14:01.200
Don't you think it's been enough?

01:14:01.977 --> 01:14:03.376
Are you all right?

01:14:04.045 --> 01:14:05.808
Do I look all right?

01:14:06.314 --> 01:14:08.608
He used to have a good reputation,
didn't he?

01:14:08.650 --> 01:14:13.279
What about you?
Does your reputation fit you?

01:14:13.321 --> 01:14:15.482
Why are you doing this?

01:14:16.091 --> 01:14:19.052
I guess I misjudged him.

01:14:19.094 --> 01:14:21.118
What are you going to do?

01:14:22.429 --> 01:14:23.862
I don't know.

01:14:25.165 --> 01:14:27.690
Reasons don't matter anymore.

01:14:28.369 --> 01:14:30.269
I don't know...

01:14:33.173 --> 01:14:36.301
I guess I'm going to put an end
to this anyway.

01:14:36.343 --> 01:14:38.607
I'll see it to the end...

01:15:19.151 --> 01:15:20.709
Who is it?

01:15:23.922 --> 01:15:25.150
Who is it?

01:16:05.562 --> 01:16:07.223
Let's see the money first.

01:16:08.698 --> 01:16:11.992
Will this be okay?
Check if this is shady money.

01:16:12.034 --> 01:16:15.094
Wait. Let me see
what kind of guy this is.

01:16:19.675 --> 01:16:21.302
What are you going to use it for?

01:16:24.279 --> 01:16:26.247
Do I have to tell you all that?

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:28.956
If we can't be sure,
we can't give it to you...

01:16:28.998 --> 01:16:31.578
No matter how much money
you pay.

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:33.451
We gonna make a deal or what?

01:16:37.792 --> 01:16:40.019
What shall we do?

01:16:40.061 --> 01:16:46.792
I can't figure out this guy.

01:16:46.834 --> 01:16:49.996
What if he's a rat for the cops?

01:16:50.038 --> 01:16:51.564
Are you sure he's not a rat?

01:16:51.606 --> 01:16:54.066
Dammit! Don't yell in my ear.

01:16:54.108 --> 01:16:56.473
Hold on...

01:16:58.812 --> 01:17:01.144
Let me think.

01:17:03.884 --> 01:17:07.078
Tell him to come tomorrow by 4.

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:08.587
With the money.

01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:13.318
Mikhail, if it were you,
would you come again?

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:14.419
Damn it!

01:17:14.461 --> 01:17:16.621
Why are you saying my name?

01:17:16.663 --> 01:17:19.556
We said we wouldn't use names.
You moron!

01:17:19.598 --> 01:17:22.159
How would you like it
if I said your name is Myung-go?

01:17:22.201 --> 01:17:25.496
How would you like it, asshole?

01:17:25.538 --> 01:17:26.930
What? Asshole?

01:17:26.972 --> 01:17:28.492
Yes, asshole,
I said you're an asshole!

01:17:28.534 --> 01:17:33.237
Damn you bastard,
come here just a second.

01:17:33.279 --> 01:17:37.511
Are you going to screw with me?
Try it, you idiot.

01:17:43.722 --> 01:17:45.747
Ah, ok, ok.

01:17:48.193 --> 01:17:50.661
Bastard. Go back to your country!

01:17:52.363 --> 01:17:56.697
So useless...

01:18:08.112 --> 01:18:10.539
Come here by 4 o'clock tomorrow.

01:18:10.581 --> 01:18:11.673
You have to come alone.

01:18:11.715 --> 01:18:16.011
Is there anyone
who can vouch for you?

01:18:16.053 --> 01:18:18.847
We can't give you anything
unless we're sure about you.

01:18:18.889 --> 01:18:22.757
Find someone by tomorrow
who can vouch for you.

01:18:24.094 --> 01:18:26.789
All right, see you tomorrow.

01:18:42.945 --> 01:18:44.238
Damn...

01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:45.806
Hey, watch it!

01:18:45.848 --> 01:18:47.508
Just shut up.

01:18:52.888 --> 01:18:54.814
What's this?
I don't recognize this number.

01:18:54.856 --> 01:18:56.616
Hey, Myung-go, Myung-go!

01:18:56.658 --> 01:18:58.785
Hello!

01:19:39.532 --> 01:19:41.659
Here's a new face!

01:19:41.701 --> 01:19:43.430
Who did you say referred you?

01:19:44.137 --> 01:19:45.863
President Han introduced me.

01:19:45.905 --> 01:19:46.905
President Han?

01:19:47.841 --> 01:19:49.103
Which President Han?

01:19:50.109 --> 01:19:51.709
He says it's President Han
from Gyungsan.

01:19:51.751 --> 01:19:53.241
Aha! Han Sang-shik...

01:19:54.379 --> 01:19:56.606
What's your connection with him?

01:19:56.648 --> 01:20:00.345
He supplies our place
with Russian dancers.

01:20:02.287 --> 01:20:03.547
A nightclub, is it?

01:20:03.589 --> 01:20:04.715
Yes.

01:20:05.657 --> 01:20:08.985
I see. But why do you
need our merchandise?

01:20:09.027 --> 01:20:11.962
I'm just following orders,
so I don't know the specifics.

01:20:14.099 --> 01:20:15.861
What happened to your face?

01:20:18.669 --> 01:20:20.763
Have you used this sort of
Merchandise before?

01:20:20.805 --> 01:20:21.697
Yes.

01:20:21.739 --> 01:20:22.899
Where?

01:20:23.541 --> 01:20:25.134
I used to be a bodyguard.

01:20:25.176 --> 01:20:26.468
You're a novice.

01:20:26.510 --> 01:20:28.704
Well, I'm not the one
who'll be using it, so...

01:20:28.746 --> 01:20:31.027
You know how to take apart
a gun and put it back together?

01:20:31.069 --> 01:20:31.874
I've done it before.

01:20:31.916 --> 01:20:32.775
Hey.

01:20:32.817 --> 01:20:34.478
Hey, bring the guns over here.

01:21:10.552 --> 01:21:12.279
Have you...

01:21:12.321 --> 01:21:13.879
Have you ever seen anything
like this?

01:21:15.016 --> 01:21:16.016
This is...

01:21:16.058 --> 01:21:19.050
probably different
from what you used.

01:21:19.628 --> 01:21:23.757
The finest gun manufactured
in Russia.

01:21:25.733 --> 01:21:29.862
The Stechkin Automatic Pistol.

01:21:29.904 --> 01:21:31.997
The KGB boys used to use it.

01:21:33.174 --> 01:21:34.664
You brought the money?

01:21:43.952 --> 01:21:44.952
Just a moment.

01:21:46.553 --> 01:21:49.488
I think we need
to check you out first.

01:21:51.725 --> 01:21:53.385
I told you already.

01:21:53.427 --> 01:21:55.520
I heard what you said, but...

01:21:56.029 --> 01:21:58.690
I'd like to hear what
Han Sang-shik has to say.

01:21:58.732 --> 01:22:01.359
Hey, give Mr. Han a call...

01:22:01.401 --> 01:22:05.397
On your way back,
bring the rapid-fire magazines.

01:22:05.439 --> 01:22:06.905
It will only take a second.

01:22:28.793 --> 01:22:32.255
Want me to teach you
how to use it while we wait?

01:22:32.297 --> 01:22:35.325
All right, now watch me
and do what I do.

01:22:35.367 --> 01:22:37.847
You have to be able to do this
to teach others how to use them.

01:22:43.241 --> 01:22:44.401
Okay, look.

01:22:52.716 --> 01:22:53.716
See?

01:22:54.318 --> 01:22:55.945
Fast, fast, fast.

01:22:57.021 --> 01:22:58.747
Take a good look.

01:22:58.789 --> 01:22:59.948
Now, first...

01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:02.317
unscrew this...

01:23:02.359 --> 01:23:06.021
then push this up and in.

01:23:06.063 --> 01:23:07.589
Easy, huh? Next...

01:23:07.631 --> 01:23:09.624
load the magazine...

01:23:09.666 --> 01:23:11.258
And then... bang.

01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:15.830
Simple, isn't it?

01:23:15.872 --> 01:23:18.397
Try one more time. Here.

01:23:27.250 --> 01:23:29.710
Okay, let's see how well
you were watching.

01:23:29.752 --> 01:23:30.878
They said they'll call back right away.

01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:32.080
Alright, alright, one second.

01:23:32.122 --> 01:23:33.514
Hey, look at this.

01:23:33.556 --> 01:23:37.450
Let's start at the same time,
okay?

01:23:37.492 --> 01:23:40.587
Hey, no bullets. Ready?

01:23:40.629 --> 01:23:42.563
One, two, three.

01:23:57.179 --> 01:23:59.669
Damn.

01:24:01.782 --> 01:24:04.376
Hello? Who?

01:24:04.418 --> 01:24:05.942
Ah, Mr. Han.

01:24:08.355 --> 01:24:10.749
You sent me someone?

01:24:10.791 --> 01:24:14.090
You know, the errand guy.

01:24:15.596 --> 01:24:16.756
Huh?

01:25:08.513 --> 01:25:11.346
What's with him? Drunk again?

01:26:15.109 --> 01:26:16.769
Brother!

01:26:16.811 --> 01:26:19.305
Why aren't you answering?

01:26:19.347 --> 01:26:20.740
You not around?

01:26:20.782 --> 01:26:22.608
I just arrived.

01:26:22.650 --> 01:26:24.310
I'm bringing the merchandise.

01:26:24.352 --> 01:26:26.512
I'll be there in about an hour.

01:26:26.554 --> 01:26:27.714
See you then.

01:27:05.291 --> 01:27:08.283
Stop staring at me
and call President Baek.

01:27:11.797 --> 01:27:13.492
I don't have much time.

01:28:37.245 --> 01:28:39.713
What are you doing?
Hurry up man...

01:28:41.083 --> 01:28:43.745
The ice rink, right?

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:47.679
I've been waiting here forever.

01:28:50.157 --> 01:28:52.387
Call me right away when you get
this message.

01:28:58.899 --> 01:29:01.265
Damn, it's fucking cold in here.

01:29:33.165 --> 01:29:34.891
Surprised?

01:29:34.933 --> 01:29:39.836
Thought you'd never
see me again? Smile.

01:29:42.875 --> 01:29:45.869
Hey, let's be professional.

01:29:45.911 --> 01:29:51.475
I thought about it, and lots of
people have bad memories, right?

01:29:51.517 --> 01:29:54.542
Memories that can never
be erased, no matter what.

01:29:55.753 --> 01:29:58.681
But at least you can erase
the traces...

01:29:58.723 --> 01:30:01.150
I mean, the people who caused
those memories.

01:30:01.192 --> 01:30:03.152
What are you talking about?

01:30:03.194 --> 01:30:07.123
Life is full of all kinds of shit.
Why are you acting like a child?

01:30:07.165 --> 01:30:10.159
I'm saying that you're just
a shitty memory for me.

01:30:10.201 --> 01:30:11.201
And I'm...

01:30:15.906 --> 01:30:18.033
oh, never mind.
Let me ask you one thing.

01:30:19.209 --> 01:30:21.109
Why did you do that to me?

01:30:26.683 --> 01:30:29.675
Oh for fuck's sake...

01:30:36.826 --> 01:30:38.384
Hey, Mr. Sunwoo...

01:30:40.563 --> 01:30:42.463
You bastard.

01:30:44.233 --> 01:30:46.292
Damn, you piece of shit!

01:30:48.204 --> 01:30:50.502
You fucking asshole!

01:30:51.207 --> 01:30:53.869
You thought I was an amateur?

01:30:59.414 --> 01:31:02.042
What's that supposed to mean?

01:31:02.584 --> 01:31:06.350
You think it's unfair? Unfair?

01:31:07.689 --> 01:31:09.882
Can't you figure out
the reason for all this?

01:31:09.924 --> 01:31:12.452
You keep looking
in all the wrong places.

01:31:12.494 --> 01:31:15.429
Then you shouldn't have come to me.

01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:20.759
Life is about suffering.

01:31:20.801 --> 01:31:22.093
Didn't you know that?

01:31:22.135 --> 01:31:24.329
Hey you, stand up straight.
Straight.

01:31:24.371 --> 01:31:27.738
I'll teach you a lesson.
Stand up straight.

01:31:31.645 --> 01:31:33.340
Just a moment. Wait.

01:32:03.142 --> 01:32:04.609
Damn.

01:32:09.247 --> 01:32:10.646
Ah, fuck.

01:32:18.323 --> 01:32:20.188
What was that?

01:32:22.193 --> 01:32:23.888
Oh, hi, how are you?

01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:28.455
Did you hear some kind of bang?

01:32:29.266 --> 01:32:31.460
The sound of a hole
being ripped out of life.

01:32:31.502 --> 01:32:34.530
Huh? Oh, okay.

01:32:34.572 --> 01:32:38.000
Things are tough these days.
Everyone's having hard times.

01:32:38.042 --> 01:32:40.102
It's getting cold.
Winter's coming.

01:32:40.144 --> 01:32:41.336
It's too damn hard to live.

01:32:41.378 --> 01:32:44.273
I wonder what the politicians
are doing for us.

01:32:44.315 --> 01:32:49.610
Because of the new bus-only lanes,
Driving downtown is harder.

01:32:49.652 --> 01:32:52.647
Mister, please take me downtown.

01:32:52.689 --> 01:32:53.986
Oh, okay.

01:33:04.767 --> 01:33:09.966
You messed with the wrong guy.
Watch yourself.

01:33:24.119 --> 01:33:25.119
Damn.

01:33:27.055 --> 01:33:28.215
Untie the ropes.

01:33:38.124 --> 01:33:39.124
Bring me a phone.

01:33:39.166 --> 01:33:39.858
What?

01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:42.095
Bring me a phone, you asshole!

01:34:08.161 --> 01:34:10.391
I'll make it short.

01:34:12.866 --> 01:34:14.766
You've seen Sunwoo, right?

01:34:17.636 --> 01:34:19.365
You mean Mr. Kim?

01:34:19.872 --> 01:34:21.064
That's right, Manager Kim.

01:34:21.106 --> 01:34:23.700
You haven't seen him lately,
have you? Where is he?

01:34:24.743 --> 01:34:26.938
How would I know?

01:34:52.203 --> 01:34:55.866
Hey Mi-ae. I'm on my way now.

01:34:57.508 --> 01:34:58.508
Yes.

01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:06.778
[1 Missed Call: KIM Sunwoo]

01:35:18.962 --> 01:35:22.157
Get out. Hurry up!

01:35:22.199 --> 01:35:23.860
Hey! Hurry up!

01:36:03.071 --> 01:36:06.370
I'll be downstairs.
So call me if something happens.

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:24.958
Here. That guy dropped this off
and just left.

01:37:39.963 --> 01:37:41.658
How did it get to this point?

01:37:48.238 --> 01:37:49.762
It's okay.

01:37:51.641 --> 01:37:53.541
It's okay...

01:38:13.929 --> 01:38:15.692
Moon Suk.

01:38:17.199 --> 01:38:18.689
Who's that?

01:39:53.724 --> 01:39:55.624
You can't come this way, sir.

01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:36.386
Let's not make a fuss.

01:41:38.057 --> 01:41:39.752
This is my last stop.

01:41:41.293 --> 01:41:43.158
I've nowhere to go.

01:41:58.276 --> 01:42:02.110
You really want to take it this far?

01:42:03.747 --> 01:42:05.806
Why did you do that to me?

01:42:08.686 --> 01:42:12.087
Tell me why.

01:42:13.657 --> 01:42:16.421
You insulted me.

01:42:16.994 --> 01:42:20.953
No, not that kind of thing.
Tell me the real reason.

01:42:26.669 --> 01:42:28.227
Tell me.

01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:36.602
I've been thinking about this
a lot, and I still don't get it.

01:42:39.415 --> 01:42:45.047
Tell me, how did we come to this?

01:42:47.456 --> 01:42:49.549
How did this happen?

01:42:49.591 --> 01:42:52.458
Were you really going to kill me?

01:42:54.429 --> 01:42:57.624
Were you really?

01:42:57.666 --> 01:43:03.195
I've served you like a dog,
for 7 years.

01:43:04.106 --> 01:43:05.767
Say me something.

01:43:06.708 --> 01:43:09.199
Anything. Tell me!

01:43:51.184 --> 01:43:55.711
What's gotten into you?

01:43:58.891 --> 01:44:00.654
Was it because of her?

01:44:18.810 --> 01:44:20.334
Don't do this.

01:45:11.527 --> 01:45:15.156
But we can't turn back
time now, can we?

01:51:21.747 --> 01:51:23.237
Hello?

01:51:29.187 --> 01:51:32.054
Hello?

01:52:11.861 --> 01:52:13.954
This is too harsh...

01:54:37.233 --> 01:54:43.097
One late autumn night,
the disciple woke up crying.

01:54:43.139 --> 01:54:48.372
So the master asked the disciple...

01:54:49.245 --> 01:54:53.541
- "Did you have a nightmare?"
- "No."

01:54:53.583 --> 01:54:56.076
"Did you have a sad dream?"

01:54:56.118 --> 01:54:58.412
"No," said the disciple.

01:54:58.454 --> 01:55:00.978
"I had a sweet dream."

01:55:01.890 --> 01:55:04.951
Then why are you crying so sadly?

01:55:04.993 --> 01:55:10.363
The disciple answered quietly,
while wiping his tears...

01:55:11.433 --> 01:55:16.029
"Because the dream
I had can't come true."
