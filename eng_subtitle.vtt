00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.300
One fine spring day...

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.040
a disciple looked at some branches
blowing in the wind.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.550
He asked his master...

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.350
"Master, are the branches moving
or is it the wind?"

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.580
Not even glancing to where
his pupil was pointing...

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.850
the master smiled and said...

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.960
"That which moves is neither
the branches nor the wind..."

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.560
"It's your heart and mind."

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.180
Sunwoo, you should
go downstairs for a moment.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.180
Why?

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.450
There's some trouble.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.920
Okay, I'll handle it.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.700
I'm sorry, but
business hours are over.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.000
Please get up and leave
before I count to three. One.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.110
Two.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.920
Three!

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.090
Sit down, stupid!

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.590
Min-gi, lock the door.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:38.870
You son of a bitch!

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.360
See you tomorrow.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.440
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.240
Yes, boss. I'll transfer
the money in the morning.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.460
All right, we'll close
for the night, sir.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.630
So, did you take care
of yesterday's business?

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.680
Yes, sir.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.530
Good. You always seem
to get things done.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.470
It looks like Chairman Baek's son
is the one making trouble.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.870
Yes, it didn't seem like
Chairman Baek did it himself.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.910
Chairman Baek's son used
to be a loan shark...

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.250
I heard he's interested
in this business.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.350
Abalone, sir.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.620
There's talk that he started
dealings with Southeast Asia.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:35.660
Why?

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:43.730
He's pushing businesses to hire
Filipina girls instead of Russians.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:48.230
Assholes. Like father, like son.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:50.940
It's me...

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.680
Moon Suk.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.910
I shouldn't have brought my car...

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.580
I hope I'm not interrupting?

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.990
Oh, it's okay.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.050
What's that? Abalone?

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.550
Get another for me.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:06.590
Yes, sir.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.520
Hey, sorry about yesterday.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.890
I can't believe that happened.
I just stepped out for a second.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.490
You must have been busy
enough upstairs.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.300
Those guys yesterday
were just local boys.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.740
Nothing to worry about, sir.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.540
- What do you think you're doing?
- Sir?

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.340
Is this how you do business?

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.810
- It was just...
- Get out now.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.290
Get out and wait for me!

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.200
Be smart.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.310
Things are going good for you now.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.940
But the world is not easy.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:14.110
You can do 100 things right, but
one mistake can destroy everything.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:16.980
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.990
I'll try to sort things out
with Chairman Baek.

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:26.560
Anyhow, the real reason
I asked you here...

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.600
I have to go to Shanghai
tomorrow afternoon on business...

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.940
I have a favor to ask
before I leave.

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:37.270
The thing is...

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.440
Pour me a drink.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.480
Oh, yes, sir. Sorry.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.990
The truth is,

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.160
I have a young girlfriend.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:05.800
Someone I really care about.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.930
She's not like you and me.
She's a special kind of person.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.610
What, am I boring you?

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:18.980
Uh... Congratulations, sir.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.940
Never mind "Congratulations."

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.850
The problem is, I think
She's seeing a new guy.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:27.690
Some young guy is hanging around her.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:32.390
It's driving me crazy,
and I couldn't tell anyone else.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.020
You know, you're the only one
I can really talk to about this.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.240
No one else knows how much
this worries me.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:45.370
So, I'd like you to watch Heesoo
for just three days.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:47.870
Watch her?

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.570
Watch over her.
Take care of her.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.280
See if she's really seeing someone.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.280
Maybe the bastard's just bothering her.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.150
See whether she's given him
her body and soul and all.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:05.990
You know young people,
a hand could brush a shoulder...

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.590
then they hold hands, then kiss,
and then... you know...

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.500
These things happen.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:18.930
But I can't stand thinking
about her like that.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:20.970
Stupid, isn't it?

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:22.100
No, sir.

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.200
Stupid.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:27.710
So... I want you to find out
who she's meeting.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.140
And what she does when they meet.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:31.680
Just for 3 days.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:36.390
This is Heesoo's address
and phone number.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:44.660
I hope she's not seeing him,
but if she is...

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.690
If they look like they're involved...

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.640
Call me right away.
Or finish them off yourself.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.260
Excuse me?

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:57.170
You know I can't stand
being lied to, right?

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.140
Love isn't love if you're
being lied to.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.410
You can contact me here
in Shanghai.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:03.540
Directly.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.090
Have a good night.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.050
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.050
No, sir.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:16.920
Have you ever been in love?

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.920
No, you haven't.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.190
That's why I'm entrusting you
with this job.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.200
That's why I like you.

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:29.540
Okay, let's go.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:32.010
Goodbye, sir!

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:14.430
President Kang told me
to give this to you personally.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.480
I'm sorry?

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.570
President Kang told me
to give this to you personally.

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:21.750
What's that?

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:02.750
Wow, it's so funny-looking.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:06.920
It's so like Mr. Kang.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.990
It's cute.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.250
Don't you think so?

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.420
Hello, not yet.

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.230
Already? Hold on a second...

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.270
President Kang also said
I should drive you today.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.080
Oh, I don't need a ride.
You can go, it's fine.

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.610
- He said I should take you myself.
- I'll let him know about it.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.150
Well, then, I'll see you later.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:20.450
If you need anything,
please contact me here.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.190
It's okay, I don't need it.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.570
Oh, give it to me anyway.

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:29.830
Goodbye.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:51.880
Heesoo, Heesoo.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.800
They sure like to get around...
Maybe it's because they're still young?

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.050
Why isn't she getting out?

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.430
Hey, Moon Suk. Everything okay?

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:55.070
What?

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.060
President Baek, that asshole...

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.970
He keeps calling and bothering me.

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:04.970
Asking how could we do this to him.

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.940
He says he lost face
because of you.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.810
He wants to meet you.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:17.480
I said no, his guys were to blame.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:21.350
But he insists on meeting you.

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.920
He's calling me
every 10 minutes.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.850
I think you should...

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:29.020
What the...
Who's bugging me now?

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:34.500
See? He's calling again.
I'm sick of getting it.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.100
You take care of it now.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.190
Hello, this is Kim Sunwoo.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.620
Well, if you have something to say,
Come here and tell me yourself.

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.160
I'm hanging up.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:10.470
I took care of it.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:17.140
Hello, hello.
He... hello? Hello?

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.140
Fucker, hung up on me.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:23.010
What a rude bastard. Hello?

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:24.180
Should I?

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:25.480
Leave it!

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:41.500
Laughing? You think that's funny?
Funny huh?

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:48.100
You go around smiling like an idiot...
That's why you get your ass kicked.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.800
Damn you bastard, look at me.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.140
Look at me, damn it.

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:56.570
Funny?

00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:59.980
I'm sorry, sir.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:02.750
Do you think it's funny?

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:05.220
Funny, funny, funny?

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.250
Funny?

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.190
Shit!

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:21.900
What hell were you thinking?
You're making it even worse!

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:29.210
Hey, this is your job.

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:31.340
I took care of it
because you weren't there.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.180
This kind of thing is your job.
You should've taken care of it.

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:36.450
They just want to do business
with us...

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:40.720
and beat us to the punch
before starting to deal.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.230
Don't you get it?

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.420
What are you lecturing me now?

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:17.020
Hey, get the phone over here.

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.150
Yes sir.

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.190
Here, sir.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:32.000
What an idiot.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.630
What? Is this voice dial?

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:39.710
Don't you think we need
to press the numbers?

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.620
Should I dial it with my mouth?

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:48.720
Stupid motherfuckers.

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.950
Call Moosung from Samseongyo.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Yes, sir.

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:42.770
You didn't answer your mobile,
so I'm leaving this message.

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:46.800
If you have some time, I need
your help for a little while.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:51.340
Just until 3 in the afternoon.
After that, it's fine.

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.940
If you get this message...

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.410
Yes, it's me. It's Sunwoo.

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:59.520
Ah, yes. At what time?
And right now it's...

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:02.590
I'll be there in an hour
at the latest.

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:04.060
I'm on my way.

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:36.480
Mr. Kang said you're a scary guy.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.030
Excuse me?

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:40.720
He did?

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.500
Yes...

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:53.000
You're an enforcer, aren't you?

00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:59.770
I gave you my card the other day.

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.310
I work at a hotel.

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:09.020
So you're an enforcer for the hotel?

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.350
I'm not that kind of person.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.060
You're so boring to talk to.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:32.840
Can I ask you something?

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.110
Sure.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.560
How did you first meet Mr. Kang?

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.090
- Wait a minute.
- Okay.

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:44.580
How much is the red lamp?

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.450
$280

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:48.950
$280?

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.860
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:55.030
Let's go.

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:02.500
What were you saying?

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.510
You asked why I am seeing Mr. Kang?

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:08.270
Yes.

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:10.940
Why do you want to know?

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:16.350
It's just... you don't have
to answer.

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.820
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.060
I'll take that now.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:38.530
I'm sorry.

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:39.870
For what?

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:42.140
Asking you those questions.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:44.780
It's okay.

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:49.610
Thanks for your time today.
I didn't want to eat by myself.

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:52.650
If you'd like to take a look,
you can enter through that door.

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:54.180
How will you return home?

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:58.420
It's easy to catch a cab here.

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:13.400
You guys ready?

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.140
- Yeah, ready.
- Okay.

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:18.480
Let's go.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.650
Hi, Min-gi.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:42.850
Someone came to see you
early this morning.

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:43.820
Who was it?

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:46.090
Oh Moosung. Do you know him?
He's one mean-looking guy.

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:48.020
Moosung? I don't know him.

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:49.530
Anything else?

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:51.960
Moon Suk is looking for you.
You want to talk to him now?

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.940
No, Min-gi, don't put him through.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.670
I'll be going to the hotel soon.

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.780
Well, well, well.

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.180
Bottoms up.

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:11.810
Someone's coming.

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:14.450
Hey, Sunwoo, come over here.

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:15.750
Sunwoo?

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:18.120
Hello.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.190
Come here, come.

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:20.090
Come.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:22.060
Why don't you come over
here for a second?

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.760
Ji-hyun, this is Mr. Kim's seat.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.330
Come.

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.260
Have a seat.

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:33.730
Hey, why are you always so
secretive about the thing you do?

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.360
What's up?

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.400
Have a drink.

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.570
Girls, get out.

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:39.640
What are you doing?

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.040
Don't ruin the fun. Relax.

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.180
Say hello to President Baek.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.480
From the Baek-Sang Management Agency.

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:51.480
Hi. I'm sorry I was rude
the other day.

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:54.320
- I guess we had a misunderstanding.
- Is that why you came here?

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.660
Yes, that and...

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.860
There was no misunderstanding.

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.890
Who do you think we are?

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.000
- Hey, Sunwoo!
- You be quiet.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.570
Don't use your people
to mess with me anymore.

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:07.630
Sunwoo!

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.170
He's here as my guest today!

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:16.640
Damn it, how could you
do this to me?

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.310
I can do this because it's you.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:31.490
Kim Sunwoo, do you think
the world is all yours?

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:35.090
Don't do anything you'll regret.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.120
Aren't you going?

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.290
- You go first.
- See you.

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:54.840
Heesoo.

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.410
Hi.

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:00.670
Did you have a good date today?

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.180
Stop kidding.

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:06.650
Where did you say
you'd sleep tonight?

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:13.760
Thanks.

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:15.450
How should we do this?

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.290
I will call you tomorrow.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:20.990
Just call me...

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:21.790
Yeah, Min-gi.

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.360
That asshole can't drive for shit!

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.960
I wasn't talking...

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:34.610
I wasn't talking to you.

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:36.600
What about Moon Suk?

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:39.370
Did you go down to the club?

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:41.570
Ok.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:39.370
Who is it?

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:45.670
Who is it?

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:14.560
Seyoon, don't!

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:20.430
Seyoon!

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:21.530
Stop it!

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.080
You bastard!

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:14.550
You know who I'm calling, don't you?

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.030
Any last words?

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.010
You finish them off yourself.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:38.930
Okay. This is what we'll do.

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.710
I'll give you a chance.

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:44.010
Listen. Both of you.

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:48.270
You must never see each other again.

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:52.810
All this today never happened
for any of us, including me...

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:54.650
This moment never existed.

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.150
Erase it completely.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:59.490
Not just from your memories,
but from your habits, too.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.460
Don't say it's hard...

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:06.490
Because this can get more serious
than either of you can imagine.

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:08.390
No point thinking about it
any longer so...

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:10.130
You, hurry, get dressed and leave.

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.600
Seyoon, don't do this.

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:26.140
- Seyoon!
- Heesoo, Heesoo.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:28.380
Heesoo.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.250
- Leave me alone!
- Listen to me!

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:31.310
Let me go!

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:38.990
Do you really believe we can just
forget about what happened here tonight?

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:40.860
- This...
- Do you... really... think so?

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:45.360
I was just looking
for the best way out of this.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:49.260
Okay, you can go now.

00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:50.700
Heesoo.

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:52.970
I don't have anything else to say.

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:56.110
You understand I can't say
anything, right?

00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:59.310
Should I thank you
for saving my life or something?

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:06.920
Please leave now.
I'll do as you say.

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:10.590
Heesoo.

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.290
That's not the way it is.

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.630
You know it can't be erased.

00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:58.030
Hey, open the window.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.470
Hey!

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:56.750
That fucking asshole!

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:08.000
What's wrong with that guy?

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:10.810
Hey!

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:21.480
Asshole!

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:27.270
Who's there?

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.440
Get out here,

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:33.650
you pricks!

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:38.120
Come on out. Now.

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:04.310
Are you alone?

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.580
Let's just go one-on-one then.

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:11.480
I'm Oh Moo-sung from Samseongyo.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.880
Whoever the fuck you are,
just get over here.

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:15.620
I'm sick of talking.

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.900
Calm down.

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:29.930
I only came to give you a message.

00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:31.810
Did Mr. Baek send you?

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:35.100
Tell me.

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:40.080
Apologize.
Then nothing will happen.

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:44.510
"I. Was. Wrong."
Three little words.

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:49.350
If you say those three words,
nothing horrible will happen.

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:54.820
"I. Was. Wrong."
Just three words.

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:58.430
Fuck. Off. Asshole.

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.500
Think it over.

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:05.700
Stop talking shit and
get the fuck outta here.

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.100
Everyone's got to live their life.

00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:47.730
Aren't you going
to answer the phone?

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:50.040
It's okay, it's not important.

00:45:58.420 --> 00:45:59.970
Would you like some coffee?

00:46:02.350 --> 00:46:04.980
No, it's okay.
I have to go soon.

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:10.490
Come over here.

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:24.300
You look pretty upset.

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:25.640
What's wrong?

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:29.000
No, I'm ok.

00:46:30.610 --> 00:46:32.210
Hey!

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:35.540
But I'm moving out.

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:37.250
I put this house up for sale.

00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:47.960
Do you know why I like you?

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:54.260
It's because you don't care
what other people think.

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:55.500
That's interesting.

00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:59.500
I used to think you were to young.

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:01.630
But I still come
to see you, like today.

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:04.040
And you still make me look for you.

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.540
That's what I like about you.

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:13.980
What do you think it is?
Being young is a gift, too.

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:21.790
As you get older,
you lose patience.

00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:51.800
Ma'am... ma'am...

00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:56.040
Ma'am... ma'am...

00:49:58.810 --> 00:50:05.340
Ma'am... ma'am...

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:28.870
Hey, Sunwoo.

00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:35.710
Well, well...
What's a great guy like you...

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:38.650
doing in a place like this, huh?

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:46.180
Oh my, you fucked up
pretty bad, didn't you?

00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:50.990
Do you know what you're doing now?

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:57.690
Shit, fucking rotten.

00:50:57.730 --> 00:51:00.790
Don't waste time,
just get rid of him.

00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:50.520
This is really gross.

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:56.450
Where's the cocky Mr. Kim now?

00:51:56.490 --> 00:52:01.790
Smile, like a professional. Smile.

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:09.200
We'll never forget about this.

00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:22.180
You have no idea what's happening.

00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:35.790
Keep your fucking head down, asshole!

00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:34.280
Why'd you do it?

00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:40.050
Why didn't you just call me?

00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:44.480
It's not like you.

00:53:44.530 --> 00:53:46.430
So what was the reason?

00:53:50.170 --> 00:53:52.600
Don't feel like talking?

00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:55.000
Want it to end like this?

00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:35.100
This is how things work
in this business.

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.540
Don't blame anybody.

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:44.380
The world's a funny place.

00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:49.680
You know what?

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:53.280
People don't matter for shit.

00:54:53.330 --> 00:54:55.590
No one can ever see
what's coming next.

00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:00.060
What are you going to do?

00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:03.800
Relax and just sit tight.

00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:05.500
Mr. Moon.

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:13.440
Yes, sir. Okay.

00:55:16.850 --> 00:55:20.010
The boss is giving you a chance.

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.550
Why didn't you tell me?

00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:28.420
Why did you make that mistake?

00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:36.760
If the two of them
never meet again...

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.090
Go on.

00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:47.340
If they can keep that promise,
I thought it would be best.

00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:53.680
No... not that kind of thing.
Tell me the real reason.

00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:57.390
Just be honest.

00:55:58.290 --> 00:56:03.090
Was it because of her?

00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:06.660
What?

00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:11.190
You can't say?

00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:17.430
Put Moon back on.

00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:19.330
Yes, sir. Okay.

00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:23.780
Yes.

00:56:24.450 --> 00:56:26.040
Okay, sir.

00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:28.880
Grab his arms.

00:56:30.010 --> 00:56:31.010
Hey, what are you doing?

00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:33.750
- Let me go, asshole.
- Bring it here.

00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:37.050
What are you doing?

00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:41.350
Let me go,

00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:48.230
Hey! Hey, Moon.

00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:49.670
Don't do this. Don't.

00:56:57.850 --> 00:57:00.970
- Don't do this.
- Hold him tight.

00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:02.470
Hey, Moon!!

00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:09.180
Hey! Moon, ah, Moon, Moon.

00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:22.320
Moon, don't do this.

00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:28.450
You...

00:59:43.150 --> 00:59:46.880
Was the hole too shallow?

00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:50.560
Congratulations, anyway.
You survived.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:50.880
There's a present for you
in the bag. Open it.

01:00:54.090 --> 01:00:56.850
Don't play games
with another man's life.

01:00:58.790 --> 01:01:03.660
Ha-ha. You asshole.

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:07.930
You're trying to be cool
to the end, huh?

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:13.730
Is this cool?

01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:24.150
Do as I say, asshole.

01:01:31.690 --> 01:01:33.850
He says you have 15 minutes.

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:37.830
Call him as soon as you figure out
what you should say.

01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:46.340
Remember what happened
with Young-duk back then?

01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:52.170
You probably told him
something like this...

01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:57.880
"No turning back.
Just accept it."

01:01:59.050 --> 01:02:01.320
And you just cut his wrist.

01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:03.950
It was awesome.

01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:13.820
Spend your 15 minutes wisely.
Don't disappoint the boss.

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:15.730
You owe him your life.

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:25.730
They're probably digging the hole
three times deeper this time.

01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:37.080
Here.

01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:26.080
Yes, I see.

01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:43.130
Did you beg for forgiveness?
So this is how it ends.

01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:46.630
You're one lucky bastard.

01:04:47.410 --> 01:04:48.940
Give it here.

01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:58.750
What's this? There's no battery!

01:06:52.330 --> 01:06:53.860
Step back.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:36.650
Stop digging. We're so fucked.

01:09:42.430 --> 01:09:46.790
Oh, those little shits.
Like they haven't done enough.

01:09:46.830 --> 01:09:48.590
They're worse than we are.

01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:50.560
Seems you have a lot of guests.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.030
Yes.

01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:56.200
He wants to run again...

01:09:58.810 --> 01:10:01.280
Anyway, I heard the news.

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:05.140
How did this happen?

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:09.710
It's a long story...

01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:15.880
You should have just left it
to us from the beginning.

01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:25.660
I'm sorry. I was rude.

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:28.970
No, it's mostly my fault.

01:10:29.470 --> 01:10:32.930
If the hammer is light,
the nail will rise back up.

01:10:37.450 --> 01:10:40.370
Let's get things straight.

01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:43.710
What would you like us
to do for you?

01:10:58.330 --> 01:11:04.270
Years ago, a smart young man
was working for me.

01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:07.900
One day I got him to do a simple job.

01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:11.040
I guess he thought it was
no big deal. He made a mistake.

01:11:11.710 --> 01:11:16.010
Thinking about it now,
it wasn't such a serious mistake.

01:11:16.050 --> 01:11:18.680
I could have just told him off
and let it go.

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:22.150
But he was kind of strange.

01:11:22.190 --> 01:11:25.020
He wouldn't admit
it was his fault.

01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:27.820
He said he didn't do
anything wrong.

01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:31.620
He could've been right.
It might have been my fault.

01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:36.590
But what are families for?

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:39.600
If the boss says you're wrong,
then you're wrong...

01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:42.840
even if you didn't really do it.

01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:47.240
Then it's over. Period!

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:50.150
But that guy lost his hand.

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:56.950
One promising guy's life ended
just like that one morning.

01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:08.220
This time, one hand is not enough.

01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:15.030
Hello? Just a second.

01:12:15.070 --> 01:12:16.470
Min-gi!

01:12:22.610 --> 01:12:24.310
Yes, hello.

01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:36.950
Yes, I see.

01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:56.500
Yes, President Won.

01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:59.700
Don't you think it's been enough?

01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:01.870
Are you all right?

01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:04.300
Do I look all right?

01:14:04.810 --> 01:14:07.100
He used to have a good reputation,
didn't he?

01:14:07.150 --> 01:14:11.770
What about you?
Does your reputation fit you?

01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:13.980
Why are you doing this?

01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:17.550
I guess I misjudged him.

01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:19.610
What are you going to do?

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:22.360
I don't know.

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:26.190
Reasons don't matter anymore.

01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:28.760
I don't know...

01:14:31.670 --> 01:14:34.800
I guess I'm going to put an end
to this anyway.

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:37.100
I'll see it to the end...

01:15:17.650 --> 01:15:19.200
Who is it?

01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:23.650
Who is it?

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:05.720
Let's see the money first.

01:16:07.190 --> 01:16:10.490
Will this be okay?
Check if this is shady money.

01:16:10.530 --> 01:16:13.590
Wait. Let me see
what kind of guy this is.

01:16:18.170 --> 01:16:19.800
What are you going to use it for?

01:16:22.770 --> 01:16:24.740
Do I have to tell you all that?

01:16:25.610 --> 01:16:27.450
If we can't be sure,
we can't give it to you...

01:16:27.490 --> 01:16:30.070
No matter how much money
you pay.

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:31.950
We gonna make a deal or what?

01:16:36.290 --> 01:16:38.510
What shall we do?

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:45.290
I can't figure out this guy.

01:16:45.330 --> 01:16:48.490
What if he's a rat for the cops?

01:16:48.530 --> 01:16:50.060
Are you sure he's not a rat?

01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:52.560
Dammit! Don't yell in my ear.

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:54.970
Hold on...

01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:59.640
Let me think.

01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:05.570
Tell him to come tomorrow by 4.

01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:07.080
With the money.

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:11.810
Mikhail, if it were you,
would you come again?

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:12.910
Damn it!

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:15.120
Why are you saying my name?

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:18.050
We said we wouldn't use names.
You moron!

01:17:18.090 --> 01:17:20.650
How would you like it
if I said your name is Myung-go?

01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:23.990
How would you like it, asshole?

01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:25.430
What? Asshole?

01:17:25.470 --> 01:17:26.990
Yes, asshole,
I said you're an asshole!

01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:31.730
Damn you bastard,
come here just a second.

01:17:31.770 --> 01:17:36.010
Are you going to screw with me?
Try it, you idiot.

01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:44.240
Ah, ok, ok.

01:17:46.690 --> 01:17:49.160
Bastard. Go back to your country!

01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:55.190
So useless...

01:18:06.610 --> 01:18:09.030
Come here by 4 o'clock tomorrow.

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:10.170
You have to come alone.

01:18:10.210 --> 01:18:14.510
Is there anyone
who can vouch for you?

01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:17.340
We can't give you anything
unless we're sure about you.

01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:21.250
Find someone by tomorrow
who can vouch for you.

01:18:22.590 --> 01:18:25.280
All right, see you tomorrow.

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:42.730
Damn...

01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:44.300
Hey, watch it!

01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:46.000
Just shut up.

01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:53.310
What's this?
I don't recognize this number.

01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:55.110
Hey, Myung-go, Myung-go!

01:18:55.150 --> 01:18:57.280
Hello!

01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:40.150
Here's a new face!

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:41.930
Who did you say referred you?

01:19:42.630 --> 01:19:44.360
President Han introduced me.

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:45.400
President Han?

01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:47.600
Which President Han?

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:50.200
He says it's President Han
from Gyungsan.

01:19:50.250 --> 01:19:51.740
Aha! Han Sang-shik...

01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:55.100
What's your connection with him?

01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:58.840
He supplies our place
with Russian dancers.

01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:02.040
A nightclub, is it?

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:03.210
Yes.

01:20:04.150 --> 01:20:07.480
I see. But why do you
need our merchandise?

01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:10.460
I'm just following orders,
so I don't know the specifics.

01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:14.360
What happened to your face?

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:19.260
Have you used this sort of
Merchandise before?

01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:20.190
Yes.

01:20:20.230 --> 01:20:21.390
Where?

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:23.630
I used to be a bodyguard.

01:20:23.670 --> 01:20:24.960
You're a novice.

01:20:25.010 --> 01:20:27.200
Well, I'm not the one
who'll be using it, so...

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.520
You know how to take apart
a gun and put it back together?

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:30.370
I've done it before.

01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:31.270
Hey.

01:20:31.310 --> 01:20:32.970
Hey, bring the guns over here.

01:21:09.050 --> 01:21:10.770
Have you...

01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:12.370
Have you ever seen anything
like this?

01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:14.510
This is...

01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:17.550
probably different
from what you used.

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:22.250
The finest gun manufactured
in Russia.

01:21:24.230 --> 01:21:28.360
The Stechkin Automatic Pistol.

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:30.490
The KGB boys used to use it.

01:21:31.670 --> 01:21:33.160
You brought the money?

01:21:42.450 --> 01:21:43.450
Just a moment.

01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:47.980
I think we need
to check you out first.

01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:51.880
I told you already.

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:54.020
I heard what you said, but...

01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:57.190
I'd like to hear what
Han Sang-shik has to say.

01:21:57.230 --> 01:21:59.850
Hey, give Mr. Han a call...

01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:03.890
On your way back,
bring the rapid-fire magazines.

01:22:03.930 --> 01:22:05.400
It will only take a second.

01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:30.750
Want me to teach you
how to use it while we wait?

01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:33.820
All right, now watch me
and do what I do.

01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:36.340
You have to be able to do this
to teach others how to use them.

01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:42.900
Okay, look.

01:22:51.210 --> 01:22:52.210
See?

01:22:52.810 --> 01:22:54.440
Fast, fast, fast.

01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:57.240
Take a good look.

01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:58.440
Now, first...

01:22:58.490 --> 01:23:00.810
unscrew this...

01:23:00.850 --> 01:23:04.520
then push this up and in.

01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:06.080
Easy, huh? Next...

01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:08.120
load the magazine...

01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:09.750
And then... bang.

01:23:12.970 --> 01:23:14.330
Simple, isn't it?

01:23:14.370 --> 01:23:16.890
Try one more time. Here.

01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:28.210
Okay, let's see how well
you were watching.

01:23:28.250 --> 01:23:29.370
They said they'll call back right away.

01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:30.580
Alright, alright, one second.

01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:32.010
Hey, look at this.

01:23:32.050 --> 01:23:35.950
Let's start at the same time,
okay?

01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:39.080
Hey, no bullets. Ready?

01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:41.060
One, two, three.

01:23:55.670 --> 01:23:58.160
Damn.

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:02.870
Hello? Who?

01:24:02.910 --> 01:24:04.440
Ah, Mr. Han.

01:24:06.850 --> 01:24:09.240
You sent me someone?

01:24:09.290 --> 01:24:12.590
You know, the errand guy.

01:24:14.090 --> 01:24:15.250
Huh?

01:25:07.010 --> 01:25:09.840
What's with him? Drunk again?

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:15.260
Brother!

01:26:15.310 --> 01:26:17.800
Why aren't you answering?

01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:19.240
You not around?

01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:21.100
I just arrived.

01:26:21.150 --> 01:26:22.810
I'm bringing the merchandise.

01:26:22.850 --> 01:26:25.010
I'll be there in about an hour.

01:26:25.050 --> 01:26:26.210
See you then.

01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:06.780
Stop staring at me
and call President Baek.

01:27:10.290 --> 01:27:11.990
I don't have much time.

01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:38.210
What are you doing?
Hurry up man...

01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:42.240
The ice rink, right?

01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:46.170
I've been waiting here forever.

01:28:48.650 --> 01:28:50.880
Call me right away when you get
this message.

01:28:57.390 --> 01:28:59.760
Damn, it's fucking cold in here.

01:29:31.660 --> 01:29:33.390
Surprised?

01:29:33.430 --> 01:29:38.330
Thought you'd never
see me again? Smile.

01:29:41.370 --> 01:29:44.360
Hey, let's be professional.

01:29:44.410 --> 01:29:49.970
I thought about it, and lots of
people have bad memories, right?

01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:53.040
Memories that can never
be erased, no matter what.

01:29:54.250 --> 01:29:57.180
But at least you can erase
the traces...

01:29:57.220 --> 01:29:59.650
I mean, the people who caused
those memories.

01:29:59.690 --> 01:30:01.650
What are you talking about?

01:30:01.690 --> 01:30:05.620
Life is full of all kinds of shit.
Why are you acting like a child?

01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:08.650
I'm saying that you're just
a shitty memory for me.

01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:09.700
And I'm...

01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:16.530
oh, never mind.
Let me ask you one thing.

01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:19.600
Why did you do that to me?

01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:28.170
Oh for fuck's sake...

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:36.880
Hey, Mr. Sunwoo...

01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:40.960
You bastard.

01:30:42.730 --> 01:30:44.790
Damn, you piece of shit!

01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:49.000
You fucking asshole!

01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:52.360
You thought I was an amateur?

01:30:57.910 --> 01:31:00.540
What's that supposed to mean?

01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:04.850
You think it's unfair? Unfair?

01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:08.380
Can't you figure out
the reason for all this?

01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:10.950
You keep looking
in all the wrong places.

01:31:10.990 --> 01:31:13.920
Then you shouldn't have come to me.

01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:19.250
Life is about suffering.

01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:20.590
Didn't you know that?

01:31:20.630 --> 01:31:22.820
Hey you, stand up straight.
Straight.

01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:26.230
I'll teach you a lesson.
Stand up straight.

01:31:30.140 --> 01:31:31.840
Just a moment. Wait.

01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:03.100
Damn.

01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:09.140
Ah, fuck.

01:32:16.820 --> 01:32:18.680
What was that?

01:32:20.690 --> 01:32:22.380
Oh, hi, how are you?

01:32:23.930 --> 01:32:26.950
Did you hear some kind of bang?

01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:29.960
The sound of a hole
being ripped out of life.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.030
Huh? Oh, okay.

01:32:33.070 --> 01:32:36.500
Things are tough these days.
Everyone's having hard times.

01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:38.600
It's getting cold.
Winter's coming.

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:39.830
It's too damn hard to live.

01:32:39.870 --> 01:32:42.770
I wonder what the politicians
are doing for us.

01:32:42.810 --> 01:32:48.110
Because of the new bus-only lanes,
Driving downtown is harder.

01:32:48.150 --> 01:32:51.140
Mister, please take me downtown.

01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:52.480
Oh, okay.

01:33:03.260 --> 01:33:08.460
You messed with the wrong guy.
Watch yourself.

01:33:22.610 --> 01:33:23.610
Damn.

01:33:25.550 --> 01:33:26.710
Untie the ropes.

01:33:36.620 --> 01:33:37.620
Bring me a phone.

01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:38.350
What?

01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:40.590
Bring me a phone, you asshole!

01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:08.890
I'll make it short.

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:13.260
You've seen Sunwoo, right?

01:34:16.130 --> 01:34:17.860
You mean Mr. Kim?

01:34:18.370 --> 01:34:19.560
That's right, Manager Kim.

01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:22.200
You haven't seen him lately,
have you? Where is he?

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:25.430
How would I know?

01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:54.360
Hey Mi-ae. I'm on my way now.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Yes.

01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:05.270
[1 Missed Call: KIM Sunwoo]

01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:20.650
Get out. Hurry up!

01:35:20.690 --> 01:35:22.360
Hey! Hurry up!

01:36:01.570 --> 01:36:04.870
I'll be downstairs.
So call me if something happens.

01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:23.450
Here. That guy dropped this off
and just left.

01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:40.150
How did it get to this point?

01:37:46.730 --> 01:37:48.260
It's okay.

01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:52.040
It's okay...

01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:14.190
Moon Suk.

01:38:15.690 --> 01:38:17.180
Who's that?

01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:54.120
You can't come this way, sir.

01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:34.880
Let's not make a fuss.

01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:38.250
This is my last stop.

01:41:39.790 --> 01:41:41.650
I've nowhere to go.

01:41:56.770 --> 01:42:00.610
You really want to take it this far?

01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:04.300
Why did you do that to me?

01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:10.580
Tell me why.

01:42:12.150 --> 01:42:14.920
You insulted me.

01:42:15.490 --> 01:42:19.450
No, not that kind of thing.
Tell me the real reason.

01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:26.720
Tell me.

01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:35.100
I've been thinking about this
a lot, and I still don't get it.

01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:43.540
Tell me, how did we come to this?

01:42:45.950 --> 01:42:48.040
How did this happen?

01:42:48.090 --> 01:42:50.950
Were you really going to kill me?

01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:56.120
Were you really?

01:42:56.160 --> 01:43:01.690
I've served you like a dog,
for 7 years.

01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:04.260
Say me something.

01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:07.690
Anything. Tell me!

01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:54.210
What's gotten into you?

01:43:57.390 --> 01:43:59.150
Was it because of her?

01:44:17.310 --> 01:44:18.830
Don't do this.

01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:13.650
But we can't turn back
time now, can we?

01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:21.730
Hello?

01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:30.550
Hello?

01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:12.450
This is too harsh...

01:54:35.730 --> 01:54:41.590
One late autumn night,
the disciple woke up crying.

01:54:41.630 --> 01:54:46.870
So the master asked the disciple...

01:54:47.740 --> 01:54:52.040
- "Did you have a nightmare?"
- "No."

01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:54.570
"Did you have a sad dream?"

01:54:54.610 --> 01:54:56.910
"No," said the disciple.

01:54:56.950 --> 01:54:59.470
"I had a sweet dream."

01:55:00.390 --> 01:55:03.450
Then why are you crying so sadly?

01:55:03.490 --> 01:55:08.860
The disciple answered quietly,
while wiping his tears...

01:55:09.930 --> 01:55:14.520
"Because the dream
I had can't come true."
